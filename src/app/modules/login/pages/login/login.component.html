          I have found RemoteU to be great place to learn new culture and work on real time challenging assignments.
          I have received great support and coaching from my RemoteU SEM who has helped me in polishing my skills and making me adapt to
          company's WSPro culture. After the RemoteU, I have immediately got job offer from Ignite company.
          I am Happy to be part of great company.
